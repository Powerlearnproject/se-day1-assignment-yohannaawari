#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


QUESTION 1: Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

ANSWER:  Software engineering is an engineering approach to software development which involves developing, testing and deploying computer applications to solve real-world problems by adhering to a set of engineering principles and best practices. The field of software engineering applies a disciplined and organized approach to software development with the stated goal of improving quality, time and budget efficiency, along with the assurance of structured testing and engineering.

Importance of Software engineering in the technology industry.
The importance of software engineering lies in the fact that a specific piece of Software is required in almost every industry, every business, and purpose. As time goes on, it becomes more important for the following reasons:

1. Reduces Complexity
Dealing with big Software is very complicated and challenging. Thus, to reduce the complications of projects, software engineering has great solutions. It simplifies complex problems and solves those issues one step at a time.
2. Handling Big Projects
Big projects need lots of patience, planning, and management, which you never get from any company. The company will invest its resources; therefore, it should be completed within the deadline. It is only possible if the company uses software engineering principles to deal with big projects without problems.
3. To Minimize Software Costs
Software engineers are paid highly as Software needs a lot of hard work and workforce development. These are developed with the help of a large number of codes. But programmers in software engineering project all things and reduce the things which are not needed. As a result of the production of Software, costs become less and more affordable for Software that does not use this method.
4. To Decrease Time
If things are not made according to the procedures, it becomes a huge loss of time. Accordingly, complex Software must run much code to get definitive running code. So, it takes lots of time if not handled properly. And if you follow the prescribed software engineering methods, it will save your precious time by decreasing it.
5. Effectiveness
Making standards decides the effectiveness of things. Therefore, a company always targets the software standard to make it more effective. And Software becomes more effective only with the help of software engineering.
6. Reliable Software
The Software will be reliable if software engineering, testing, and maintenance are given. As a software developer, you must ensure that the Software is secure and will work for the period or subscription you have agreed upon.

QUESTION 2: Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

ANSWER: The field of Software Engineering has evolved greatly. The first computers were massive and expensive and programming them was complex and labour-intensive task. Early programmers often had to write machine code which is a low-level language that controls the computer's hardware.
Key milestone includes:
a. 1948: Grace Hooper developed the first compiler, which translate human readable codes into machine code.
b. 1958: FORTRAN, The first High-level programming language was released.
C. 1960's: The Term "Software Engineering"  is coined.

QUESTION 3: List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

ANSWER:
Stage 1: Project Planning
The planning stage (also called the feasibility stage) is exactly what it sounds like the phase in which developers will plan for the upcoming project.
It helps to define the problem and scope of any existing systems, as well as determine the objectives for their new systems.

Stage 2: Gathering Requirements & Analysis
The analysis stage includes gathering all the specific details required for a new system as well as determining the first ideas for prototypes. This includes all the specifications for software, hardware, and network requirements for the system they plan to build. 
Stage 3: Design
The design stage is a necessary precursor to the main developer stage. Developers will first outline the details for the overall application, alongside specific aspects, such as its User interfaces, System interfaces, Network and network requirements and Databases.
Stage 4: Coding or Implementation
The development stage is the part where developers actually write code and build the application according to the earlier design documents and outlined specifications.
Stage 5: Testing
Building software is not the end. Now it must be tested to make sure that there aren’t any bugs and that the end-user experience will not negatively be affected at any point. During the testing stage, developers will go over their software carefully, noting any bugs or defects that need to be tracked, fixed, and later retested.
Stage 6: Deployment
Once the testing is done, and the product is ready for deployment, it is released for customers to use. The size of the project determines the complexity of the deployment. The users are then provided with the training or documentation that will help them to operate the software
Stage 7: Maintenance
Developers must now move into maintenance mode and begin practicing any activities required to handle issues reported by end-users. Furthermore, developers are responsible for implementing any changes that the software might need after deployment.


QUESTION 4:  Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

ANSWER:   Agile is an iterative approach to software development, emphasizing flexibility and collaboration among cross-functional teams. It focuses on delivering small, incremental releases, adapting to changes throughout the development process. 
In contrast, Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. Changes are difficult to incorporate once a phase is completed. Agile promotes adaptability and customer feedback, while Waterfall provides a structured plan but may struggle with accommodating changes late in the development cycle.
Agile is flexible and iterative, emphasizing continuous feedback and adaptation. Waterfall is sequential and rigid, with distinct phases completed in order. Agile promotes ongoing collaboration, while Waterfall focuses on thorough planning and execution in predetermined stages.

Waterfall methodology is often used when there is a high level of reliability needed for the project. Waterfall is common for projects that, require intense human review because the possibility that you got it wrong could lead eventually to loss of life. The Department of Defense and the aerospace industry are two examples.

The Agile methodology in this instance, the Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated the responsibility of the government to service all needs of the community in an environment where the context for decision making changed almost daily. Government agencies need to employ creative problem solving while navigating governance and complex procurement and partnership processes. Agile ways of working  increased the visibility of what is being worked on and also highlight what work is being prioritised so that policy and service can be created to drive the outcome of the highest value.


QUESTION 5: Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

ANSWER:  Software developers use their programming skills to create software. They follow the guidelines established by the product owner. They are also responsible for creating proper software documentation, and developing updates and upgrades, and resolving issues for existing software, which encompasses maintenance.

A Quality Assurance engineer or analyst identifies bugs, system flaws, and other software issues in your product before it is released to the public. They also confirm that your products or services meet company and industry standards. Other duties include overseeing product problem resolutions, running software compatibility tests, and driving product improvements. 

A project manager is responsible for supervising the development process and its market entry. To accomplish this, product managers generate ideas for market entry, manage pricing policy, plan and control tasks, and set goals and metrics to achieve the company's objectives and targets. They're involved in analyzing industry, market, and competitor trends to ensure the product's competitiveness. Also responsible for closely collaborating with software developers and tech leads, team leaders, marketing specialists, sales representatives, and stakeholders. Holding meetings with all team members and ensuring team members know what's expected of them.


QUESTION 6: Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

ANSWER:  An integrated development environment or IDE is defined as a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. 
Importance of IDE include:
1. Accelerates development and delivery.
Without an IDE interface, programmers must configure numerous development tools individually. By combining an IDE, developers may access the identical list of capabilities in one location, eliminating the need to often transfer between tools.
2. Encourages standardization
A group of software developers and DevOps engineers will stick to a standardized method of operations by working within the same development environment. 
3. Improves code accuracy.
Instead of working like a code editor, the IDE will do additional checks to guarantee that the code is error-free and enable users to compile the code so that they may execute it instantly.
4. Integration opportunities.
Numerous open-source code management systems are often compatible with cloud-based IDEs. GitHub is a cloud-based code-sharing and version control application that enables users to build their workflows.
5. Automatically builds executables
Developers require a compiler to convert source code to an executable. The compiler turns source code into platform-specific machine code. Compilers and associated development tools, including debuggers and profilers, are generally included inside an integrated development environment (IDE). Most compilers are intended to operate with a particular IDE or editor. 
6. Drives efficiency.
Integrated development environments (IDEs) boost developer productivity, decrease installation time and accelerate development activities by keeping developers informed of the most current threats, best practices, and standardizing the development cycle so everyone can participate.

Examples of IDEs:
Microsoft Visual Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans, Android Studio, BlueJ, Komodo, IntelliJ IDEA.

The Importance of Version Control in Software Development.
1. Collaboration and Teamwork: Version control systems enable multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, allowing them to share their contributions, review each other’s work, and merge changes seamlessly.
2. Tracking Changes and Reverting to Previous Versions: Version control systems maintain a detailed history of all changes made to the codebase, allowing developers to easily track the evolution of the project.
3. Branching and Merging: Version control systems enable developers to create separate branches of the codebase, allowing them to experiment with new features or bug fixes without disrupting the main development line. 
4. Backup and Disaster Recovery: Version control systems act as a backup for the codebase, providing a secure and reliable way to store and retrieve project files. In the event of a system failure, hardware malfunction, or data loss, developers can easily restore the project to a previous, working state, minimizing the impact on the development timeline.
5. Auditing and Accountability: Version control systems maintain a detailed log of all changes made to the codebase, including who made the changes and when. This information can be invaluable for auditing purposes, project management, and ensuring accountability within the development team.
6. Streamlined Deployment and Release Management: Version control systems play a crucial role in the deployment and release management of software projects. By maintaining a clear and organized codebase, developers can more easily identify and package the necessary components for deployment, ensuring a smooth and reliable release process.

Examples of Version Control systems:
Git, Mercurial, Svn, Bitbucket, Helix Core, GNU Bazaar, Darcs, Monotone.

QUESTION 8: Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

ANSWER: 
1. Unit Testing is typically performed by the developer. It is a testing method using which every independent module are tested to determine if there is any issue by the developer himself. 
Unit testing is a crucial aspect of automated testing for digital applications. It ensures stability and resilience by validating the performance of individual modules.

2. Integration Testing: Integration testing is the process of testing the interface between two software units or modules.
Integration testing helps to identify and resolve any issues that may arise when components are combined, such as compatibility issues, performance problems, incorrect communication, or data corruption

3. System testing is a significant stage in the software development life cycle that involves testing the complete system to ensure that it meets the specified requirements. During this testing, various techniques are used to identify defects, validate the system's functionality, and ensure its overall quality. 
This testing is necessary because it helps to identify any defects or issues that may arise when the software is deployed to the end users.

4. Generally, acceptance testing is used to evaluate whether the application works as per the specified business requirements or real-time scenarios.
The main purpose and importance of acceptance testing is to verify that a system: Meets all of its functional and non-functional requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


QUESTION 1: Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

ANSWER:  Prompt engineering is the process of writing, refining and optimizing inputs to encourage generative AI systems to create specific, high-quality outputs.
Importance of Prompt Egineering: 
Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps ensure that the generated output meets your expectations and requirements.


QUESTION 2:  Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

ANSWER:  
Vague Prompt: I need a location where I can get food in Lagos.

More Specific, Concise: I need a location where I can get local food like amala and ewedu, banga and eferiro soup around Ikeja, in Lagos. 

The improved prompt prompt is more effective because it is less vague. First it gives more clarity to the kind of food being searched instead of food generally which is vague. There is a specification of the food being local so it is streamlined. The location is also more concise because Lagos is vague some of the search might not be favourable in terms of proximity so you specify the area within Lagos.
